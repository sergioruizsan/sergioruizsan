### What is Sergio doing? 😄

If the day had more than 24 hours I would like to learn everything in the world hahah, but I am a human, so... most of the time you will just see me working as a 
front-end web developer, although when needed (or when I want a break) I switch to back-end or devops.

### Some hobbies

- 📚 Read books. I really enjoy tech (related to my field) and human behaviour/relationships topics. Less often, but equally interesting I like geopolitics and historical topics.
- ✏️ Write few articles, occasionally
- 🔌 Play with System On Chip or Microcontrollers devices for IoT
- 🔭 Astronomy
